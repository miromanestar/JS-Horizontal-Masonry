# JS-Horizontal-Masonry
An example of a horizontal masonry layout using javascript!

[Live demo here!](https://miromanestar.github.io/JS-Horizontal-Masonry/)

Essentially allows CSS to find the expected height of the items in a vertical masonry layout, sets that height (Plus an additional buffer to accomodate discrepancies) to the container, and applies some CSS flex rules depending on the window/screen size.

That way, the JS is extremely lightweight and doesn't need to perform nearly as many calculations as traditional horizontal masonry layout solutions.
